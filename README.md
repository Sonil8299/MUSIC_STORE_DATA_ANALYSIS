# MUSIC_STORE_DATA_ANALYSIS 
# SQL PROJECT
In this project, I undertook a comprehensive analysis of a music playlist database using SQL, with the primary objective of facilitating the store's comprehension of its business growth trajectory. Through diligent examination of the dataset, I leveraged SQL queries to extract valuable insights that could address pivotal questions, subsequently enabling informed decision-making and strategic planning.
